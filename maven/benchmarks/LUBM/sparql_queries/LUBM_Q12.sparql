# Query12
# The benchmark data do not produce any instances of class Chair. Instead, each
# Department individual is linked to the chair professor of that department by 
# property headOf. Hence this query requires realization, i.e., inference that
# that professor is an instance of class Chair because he or she is the head of a
# department. Input of this query is small as well.
