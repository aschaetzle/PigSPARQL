# PigSPARQL

Pig Latin is a high-level language developed at Yahoo! Research designed for data analysis tasks, which is automatically transformed into MapReduce jobs and executed in a Hadoop cluster.
PigSPARQL is a translation from SPARQL 1.0 to Pig Latin, which allows to execute SPARQL queries on large RDF graphs with MapReduce.
