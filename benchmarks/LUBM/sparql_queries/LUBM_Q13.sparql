# Query13
# Property hasAlumnus is defined in the benchmark ontology as the inverse of
# property degreeFrom, which has three subproperties: undergraduateDegreeFrom, 
# mastersDegreeFrom, and doctoralDegreeFrom. The benchmark data state a person as
# an alumnus of a university using one of these three subproperties instead of
# hasAlumnus. Therefore, this query assumes subPropertyOf relationships between 
# degreeFrom and its subproperties, and also requires inference about inverseOf.
